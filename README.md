Generative AI is on everyone's lips: Adobe Photoshop allows objects in images to be exchanged by simply entering a prompt, and Microsoft Copilot has come to Office and Windows. With WebLLM and Prompt API, we can now bring Generative AI to your Angular app: locally and offline-capable. We generate images from text input and add a chatbot to a to-do application.

## Installationsanweisungen

If you want to code along, please bring a powerful device with Windows or macOS, a current version of Chrome, Node.js, an editor of your choice, and at least 20 GB of free hard disk space.

Ideally, this should be your private device, as group policies or company proxies tend to throw a spanner in the works.

After cloning the repository, please run the following commands on the command line:

```sh
cd ijs-munich-2025-genai
npm i
```
